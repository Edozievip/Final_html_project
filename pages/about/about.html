        <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h4 style="background-color: aqua; width: 80%;">My name is <b>Ezeh Christian Chiedozie</b>. I obtained HND in Civil Engineering. I enrolled in online course to learn game development and app design using C++ during the covid-19 pandemic period. After learning the basic syntax of C++, I built a snake game with the help of my tutor. I stopped learning the language when we resumed back to school after the covid-19. Due to my love for coding and dsigning, I enrolled again for web development using wordpress after which I designed a blogging site and an E-commerce site. Due to some to some limitation and many addons, themes etc that you have to purchase when designing websites using wordpress, I decided to learn web development using html, CSS and JS.</P>
